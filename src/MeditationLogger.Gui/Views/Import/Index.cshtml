<p>This page allows you to import XML data from another LogBook.</p>

<p>To get the XML data in the first place, in the other Meditation Logger Application, go to the Export page and download it as XML.</p>

<p>Before importing, please note the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any logs in the XML file with the same Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and the same &quot;edit time&quot; as what is already in the database will be ignored.</li>
    <li>Any logs in the XML file that does not contain an GUID will be imported.  A new GUID will be generated and saved with the log to the database.</li>
    <li>Any logs in the XML file that contains a GUID that is not already in the database will be imported.</li>
    <li>Any logs in the XML file with the same GUID but a newer &quot;edit time&quot; will replace the log in the database.  The log in the database's edit time will be updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>To begin, select the XML file to upload.</p>
